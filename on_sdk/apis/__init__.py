# Import all APIs into this package.
# If you have many APIs here with many many models used in each API this may
# raise a `RecursionError`.
# In order to avoid this, import only the API that you directly need like:
#
#   from .api.auth_api import AuthApi
#
# or import this package, but before doing it, use:
#
#   import sys
#   sys.setrecursionlimit(n)

# Import APIs into API package:
from on_sdk.api.auth_api import AuthApi
from on_sdk.api.filter_api import FilterApi
from on_sdk.api.needs_api import NeedsApi
from on_sdk.api.organizations_api import OrganizationsApi
from on_sdk.api.projects_api import ProjectsApi
from on_sdk.api.users_api import UsersApi
